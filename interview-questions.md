# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?
 

Your answer: Git is the method of communicating code between developers. Github is the website and space utilized to facilitate this process.

Researched answer: Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history. Github is a hosting service (cloud-based) that lets you manage Git repositories.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: All I can remember about Boolean values is that they return 'True' or 'False'

Researched answer: Logical operators such as: "&" "&&" "|" "||" "\" return a Boolean value

3. What is an index? 

Your answer:What is the difference between index and value? The index is the space the value takes in an array. The value can be anything you type into that index. Indexes begin at 0, so the first item will be reflected as 0, not 1!

Researched answer: The index contains the position of an expression in a string.

4. What is iteration? 

Your answer: An iteration is a version of something. So an iteration of a piece of code is each time you run it and then change it to run again for the next iteration.

Researched answer: An iteration is found when you program a loop,  where code is searching for something. Each attempt by the code to find something is the iteration.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: Pair programming is done with two developers, using shared screens and copious communication. One of the programmers is the driver, sharing their screen and actively coding, while the other is the navigator, reading instructions and generally directing the driver.

Researched answer: Pair programming is a system that requires two programmers working at a solitary workstation. One programmer is the driver who writes the code, and the other is the observer or navigator who navigates and critiques each line of code as the driver writes it. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: built-in methods in Javascript that act on arrays. A specific subset of built in methods that take a function as an argument

2. Jest: Javascript testing framework designed to ensure correctness of any Javascript codebase

3. Objects: JS data type that has collections of <key: value> pairs. Objects can contain static information as well as actions in the form of methods.

4. Method: when a function belongs to an object

5. Classes: blueprint for objects, reusable, customizable much like functions. A particular type of function that contain data and behavior. Classes have their own scope
